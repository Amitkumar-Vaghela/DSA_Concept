//  What is ArrayList?
/*
ArrayList is a resizable-array implementation of the List interface in Java. It is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store a collection of elements.

Key Features of ArrayList:

Dynamic Size: ArrayList can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.
Ordered Collection: ArrayList maintains the order in which elements were added.
Index-Based Access: Elements can be accessed using an index, similar to an array.
Fast Random Access: ArrayList provides fast random access to elements, making it suitable for large datasets.
Fail-Fast Iterators: ArrayList's iterators are fail-fast, meaning they will throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the list is modified while iterating.  */

/* Common Methods of ArrayList:--
add(E e): Adds an element to the end of the list.
add(int index, E e): Adds an element at a specific index.
get(int index): Returns the element at a specific index.
set(int index, E e): Replaces the element at a specific index.
remove(int index): Removes the element at a specific index.
contains(Object o): Returns true if the list contains the specified element.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the list.
isEmpty(): Returns true if the list is empty.
clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
toArray(): Returns an array containing all elements in the list. */
